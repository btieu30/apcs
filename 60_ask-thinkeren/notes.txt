HW60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle
2022-02-07
time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
* We learned how the MergeSort algorithm works and how we can apply the
  algorithm to sort objects in the real-world, such as a deck of cards.
* We went over the term 'outsourcing' and how it helps us optimize or make
  processes more efficient.

QCC:
* How does the efficiency of MergeSort compare to our previous sorting
  algorithms such as BubbleSort, SelectionSort and InsertionSort?
* Will the thinkeren ever be able to successfully sort a deck of cards using
  MergeSort?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
0: Accept the deck of cards
1: Ask 'Is it sorted (does the deck have only one card)?'
  a. yes; hand your card back to the thinker that gave it to you
  b. no; split the deck in half and pass on both halves to thinkeren that do
     not possess any cards
2: If your answer to q1 was 'no', wait for the pair of thinkeren to return both
    parts of the deck
3: Once both halves are returned, compare and sort both halves
4: Repeat!
