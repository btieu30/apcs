HW #6 -- 06_paradigms (programs to print "Hello, world!" in Scheme, NetLogo and Python)
2021-09-28

Scheme:
(display "Hello, world!")

Netlogo:
print "Hello, world!"

Python:
print("Hello, world!")

Similarities: all use quotation marks to denote "Hello, world!" as a string, and allows it to print.

Differences: Scheme uses the function name display, rather than print such as NetLogo and Python. Also, when considering the functions written, they all have different line designating the start and end of each function. For example, Scheme uses define, NetLogo uses to, and Python uses def.
