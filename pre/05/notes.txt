Summer Pre-Work 05 - Value Methods

Number 2:
No trouble writing and succesfully running the function to recieve the correct output.

Number 3:
Again, no trouble forming the function itself and getting it to return the correct outputs when determining whether or not something is a triangle.

Number 8: 
Had some difficulty with the idea of recursion within the ackermann function but was able to eventually code the method after looking at the diagram presented on the website.
