Summer Pre-Work 07 - Arrays

Number 1: 
No trouble successfully writing and running the powArray method, but did struggle trying to use the enhanced for loop for the histogram method. 

Number 4: 
Had trouble writing the method and keeping track of the array's index to find the largest number but was somehow able to get the method to return the correct answer.

Number 5: 
Again was able to get the function to work, but didn't really get the Sieve algorithm, had to consult help to get this to work. 

General ideas: 
Didn't really get the idea of the enhanced for loop and how that works.
