Summer Pre-Work 08 - Coding Bat Problems

Value Functions: 
Didn't understand the rounding in the sumofSines, but able to get it to work eventually. No trouble writing the other methods.

Conditionals: 
No trouble writing both of the conditional methods!

Loops: 
Again, no trouble writing the stringTimes method.

Arrays:
Only struggled with the scoresIncreasing method and figuring out how to traverse along the array and keep track of its indexes.
