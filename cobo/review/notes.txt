Activity 1:

1a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b) Yes, this method requires a String parameter. When you try to pass a
    different parameter type, you receive an error message saying that the
    parameter type cannot be converted into a String (incompatible types).
1c) The method returns a double value.

2) sentimentVal("cheese"); --> 0.01
   sentimentVal( "democracy" ); --> 0.36
   sentimentVal( "Russia" ); --> -0.22
   sentimentVal( "computer" ); --> 0.15

3a) Yes, because sentimentVal takes a single String and returns a double value.
3b) No, because sentimentVal only takes String parameters.
3c) No, because sentimentVal only takes one String.

Activity 2:

4) The totalSentiment method works by storing the file contents in a String rev
   using the textToString() method. It also initializes a double that will accumulate
   the total sentiment value. A while method iterates until there are no more spaces
   in rev, and during each iteration, the sentimentVal of each word substring(found with
   knowledge of indexOf(" ") and by using removePunctuation()) is added to the accumulation
   double. That substring is then cut out of rev. After the for loop, there should be one word
   left in the String, so its sentimentVal is added to the accumulation double, which is
   then returned.

5a) The ratings generally make sense. They fall well into the general positive/negative
   rating ranges, but they are not as extreme. For example, AnotherReview.txt should be a five
   star review but is categorized as a three star review.
5b) One adjustment could be adding a scale factor/exponent to the totalSentiment() method
   so that reviews which fall on the extreme ends are given an extra amplification, while neutral
   reviews stay close to the center of the spectrum. Another adjustment could be ignoring words that
   are too close to 0 (and basically neutral) when summing up the sentiment values.

6a) The student has made a logical error in basing conditionals and final star ratings on totalSentiment()
   alone. For example, if a review is composed of enough negative words (for example, 3000 negative adjectives),
   it will almost certainly exceed 15 in totalSentiment and show as a four star rating, while a review with
   one positive word (and consisting of a total of one word) will categorize as a one or two star review.
6b) This error can be fixed by taking the average of sentiment values rather than the total in the conditional.
   totalSentiment() may be divided by a word count to find this average.In this way, a high word count cannot
   outweigh a general negative sentiment, and a low word count cannot pull down the rating of a positive review.

Activity 3:

3) The indexOf() method returns the position of the earliest s, where s is the String parameter. The substring()
   method returns a String consisting of the characters from indexes a to b, non-inclusive of b and where a and b
   are its two int parameters. The indexOf() method can identify where a String breaks, particularly at a space, and
   s.substring(0, s.indexOf(" ")) and s.substring(s.indexOf(" ")+1) can split the String s into two parts. It is necessary
   to add 1 to the position of the space when copying the remainder of the String because we would not like to include
   the space character at the beginning of the substring and would like to begin the substring from the character
   immediately following the space.

5) Calling static methods does not require an instance of the Review class, but calling non-static methods does require
   using an instance of the Review class.

6) fakeReview() could be modified to create a fake positive review by replacing adjectives with only words from
   positiveAdjectives.txt, and it could be modified to create a fake negative review by replacing adjectives with
   only words from negativeAdjectives.txt.

Activity 4
1) One possible reason to autogenerate a negative review is if a reviewer had a bad experience but is not sure where to start
   in their review. Autogenerating a negative review can provide a base/template for them to edit.

2) One possible reason to autogenerate a positive review is if a reviewer had great experiences at several restaurants and would
   like to mass add unique reviews to all of their Yelp pages but does not have the time to individually craft each one.

3)
- remove punctuation in totalSentiment
