##### Lab06 -- Read/Review/Expand - cobo review lab

errata:

* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker

Summary:
* The acitivities in the lab felt straightforward for the most part.
* The starRating method was overall very broad and we were a bit confused about how to approach the problem.
* The creation of the adjectives text files were tedious and we thought it was odd that we had to populate them ourselves.
