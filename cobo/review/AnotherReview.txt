Where have you been all of my life?
The neighborhood has its share of bars, but it was missing exactly what Charlotte cafe brings.

The space is big. The seating is plentiful. The staff is so nice. The wifi is excellent. The coffee is strong.

I have been twice in the last two days and this will be regular staple in my weekly routine.

Thank you for making the perfect cafe for the neighborhood. We appreciate you!
