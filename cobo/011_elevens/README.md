L07 -- But These Go Up to Eleven
2022-03-21

This lab was overall pretty straightforward and was great review of all the skills we've learned in this class. For instance, list was used in Deck.java, and we manipulated said list by shuffling it and swapping cards, comparable to our card sorting activity in class. Learning the game of elevens and experimenting with the built-in java GUI was pretty interesting too. Our team enjoyed the experience, while some parts were tedious.
