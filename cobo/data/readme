TNPG: Dysentery
Roster: Fang Chen, Brianna Tieu, Ethan Lam

Our overall experience with this lab can be summarized with the 
word "success." We spent ages trying to get Welcome01.java to
compile, to which succeeded with the help of le QAF posters. 
Aside from this though, we had quickly got through the other 
activities. 

We skimmed through activity one, learning a little bit data sets. Activity two was the dealio regarding Welcome01.java, which enlightened us about jar files and javac flags. Though when we ran it, we got a lot of FileNotFoundException errors, the NYC temperature did print at the end!
