  algo as pseudocode:
  ------------------------------
      v = arr[c]
      swap arr[c], arr[b]
      s = a
      for i in [a..b-1]
          if arr[i] < v
              swap arr[s], arr[i]
              s+=1
      swap arr[b], arr[s]

  DISCO
   Why must mysterion return value s?

  QCC

  q0: What does it do?
  a0: MYSTERION splits the array into two seperate arrays.
       At the chosen partition, elements are organized so that all the smaller
       elements are to the left and the greater elements are to the right.

  q1: O(?)
  a1: O(n)? The array is iterated through once with a for loop.
